### Duck Typing aka Structural Type System

One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural typing”.

In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.

The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object’s fields to match.

<pre>
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string) {
  if (typeof padding === "number") {
    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
  }
  return padding + input;
}
</pre>
